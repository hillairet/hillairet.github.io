Two goals can simply summarize the purpose of this blog:

* Learning
* Sharing knowledge

While I have always been learning things here and there leading to some basic
constant learning, I have come to realize the importance of being proactive
about constant learning and I made it one of my top priorities in life.
There is no better way to learn than to teach
(see [Feynman Learning](https://blog.doist.com/feynman-technique/)).
Therefore I'll be the first to benefit from what I write about.
The first but hopefully not the only one.

Knowledge is humanity's most important resource. With knowledge we make more
amazing food (Camembert anyone?), build cities (Have you been to Tokyo?),
cure diseases (bye bye small pox!), and overall improve our lives
(what would life be without a snuggy?).
As such, it is a common good and must be proactively shared. The internet
has created the best tool to share knowledge to date, we must now keep
filling it with what we have.
